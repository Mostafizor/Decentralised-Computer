# A simplified Python implementation of the Ethereum decentralised computer.

This repository is the result of my efforts to understand Ethereum by way of implementation.

The implementation will consist of the following components:

*A virtual machine that can execute rudimentary programs (smart contracts)
*A blockchain
*A Peer-to-Peer communication network
*A native cryptocurrency to pay for computation on the decentralised computer
