# A simplified Python implementation of Ethereum

This repository is the result of my efforts to understand Ethereum by way of implementation.

The implementation will consist of the following components:

1. A virtual machine that can execute rudimentary programs (smart contracts)
2. A blockchain
3. A Peer-to-Peer communication network
4. A native cryptocurrency to pay for computation on the decentralised computer
