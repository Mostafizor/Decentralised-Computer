# A simplified Python implementation of Ethereum

Ethereum is essentially a decentralised computer which can execute smart contracts (computer programs) supported by its own native cryptocurrency known as Ether (ETH). This repository is the result of my efforts to understand Ethereum by way of implementation. 

The implementation will consist of the following components:

1. A virtual machine that can execute rudimentary smart contracts
2. A blockchain with a Proof of Work (PoW) mining algorithm
3. A Peer-to-Peer communication network
4. A native cryptocurrency to pay for computation on the decentralised computer
